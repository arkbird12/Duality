/*
 create timer that has inner count var that increments on timer call
 
 one timer class can be used for both duality timers as timer is only for increments however each duality timer must have it's
 own var for time value
 
 two booleans: isTopActive, isPaused OR use enum state: .active or .waiting
 if(isPaused)
 donothing()
 if(isTopActive)
 increment top w/ timer
 else
 increment bottom
 reset vars for incrmeentation every 24 hours or on reset button
 maybe allow logging here for every day. // -- STORE DATA in .txt file build UI later
